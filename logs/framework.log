PROMPT: You are a Coordinator Agent responsible for optimizing Quality of Service (QoS) in a multi-user RIS-assisted 6G system.

Your key responsibilities:
1. Analyze user scenarios including locations, channel conditions, and delta SNR values
2. Learn patterns from historical data to make optimal user selection decisions
3. Select the best optimization algorithm from {Analytical, GD, Manifold, AO}
4. Decide on base station transmit power adjustments within 20-45 dB range
5. Use historical iteration feedback to improve future decisions

Key Guidelines:
- Select users for optimization based on learned patterns, not fixed thresholds
- Consider user locations, channel conditions (LoS/NLoS, fading), and current delta SNR
- Prioritize scenarios where optimization can provide meaningful improvements
- Adapt power levels based on scenario complexity and user distribution
- Learn from evaluator feedback to avoid repeating poor decisions

Output format should be JSON with: selected_users, selected_algorithm, base_station_power_change

PROMPT: You are a Coordinator Agent responsible for optimizing Quality of Service (QoS) in a multi-user RIS-assisted 6G system.

Your key responsibilities:
1. Analyze user scenarios including locations, channel conditions, and delta SNR values
2. Learn patterns from historical data to make optimal user selection decisions
3. Select the best optimization algorithm from {Analytical, GD, Manifold, AO}
4. Decide on base station transmit power adjustments within 20-45 dB range
5. Use historical iteration feedback to improve future decisions

Key Guidelines:
- Select users for optimization based on learned patterns, not fixed thresholds
- Consider user locations, channel conditions (LoS/NLoS, fading), and current delta SNR
- Prioritize scenarios where optimization can provide meaningful improvements
- Adapt power levels based on scenario complexity and user distribution
- Learn from evaluator feedback to avoid repeating poor decisions

2. **Algorithm Selection**: Based on the algorithm patterns from similar scenarios, I will select the gradient_descent_adam_multi algorithm, as it has a higher confidence level of 0.60 compared to manifold_optimization_adam_multi with a confidence level of 0.40.

3. **Base Station Power Adjustment**: Considering the scenario complexity and user distribution, I will increase the base station power by 5 dB to ensure that all selected users receive a strong signal. This adjustment will also help to compensate for the users with lower delta SNR values.

Explanation:

* Performance Summary: The optimization resulted in significant SNR improvements for users 1, 2, and 3, but users 4 and 5 still struggle to meet requirements. This indicates that the optimization was partially successful.
* Power Efficiency Status: The power efficiency status is "wasteful" because multiple users (1, 2, and 3) have a delta SNR > 5 dB, indicating that the power increase was excessive.
* Fairness Assessment: The fairness assessment is "unfair" because users 4 and 5 still struggle to meet their requirements, while users 1, 2, and 3 have significantly improved SNR values.
* Recommendations:
	+ Power Adjustments: Recommend increasing power for users 4 and 5 to help them meet their requirements. Recommend reducing power for users 1, 2, and 3 to improve power efficiency.
